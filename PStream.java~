	//Stream buffer Prefetching
	// Prefetch is enable or disabled for each cache
	// has N Stream buffers
	// Each buffer contains M memory blocks
	// Each has M valid bits
	// N = 0 disables prefetch
	//
	// cache receives read or write, checks cache and first entry in stream
	// if miss both, prefetch and replace next X+1 through X+M into stream buffer
	// no writeback from stream buffer
	// if hit in stream, allocate X from stream, shift stream and fetch X+M+1
	// multiple stream buffers are searched in parrallel, with LRU stream being updated
	// when dirty blocks evicted from cache, that block invalidated in stream buffer
